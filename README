EarthquakeList is an Android app that displays list of earthquakes that occurred during the last 24
hours.

This app consists of two activities: First activity is a list of earthquakes that occurred,
displaying three minimal information, time, magnitude, and place, of each earthquake. Clicking the
earthquake from the list will launch the second activity, which displays more detailed information
of clicked earthquake. Detail activity displays time, place, magnitude, longitude & latitude, and
potential tsunami.

The list is composed from the feed data on USGS site, and this is done by the app's two components,
retriever and parser. Data retriever connects with URLConnection and pulls json data from USGS,
then this json data is passed on to the parser, which reads and stores earthquakes to data type
class, EarthquakesSummary, and returns it to list activity for it to display.

The earthquake list is ordered with the most recent incidents on top, as data on USGS site is
provided in that order. User can also set the filter on the list, select on from all, M1.0+, M2.5+,
M4.5, and significant, and only the earthquakes that fall under selected filter will be listed. This
is done simply by changing the url to pre-filtered URL and have the retriever get the filtered data
from USGS.
